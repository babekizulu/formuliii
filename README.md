# Foreword (even though it's at the end...)

I'd love to give a big thanks to my parents, who inspire me to work hard and to persevere through adversity. Your lessons have shaped me and continue to shape me into a person who enjoys learning and finding new ways to solve problems and help people. I love you! I'd like to thank my sister. Every time my computer is frozen or I'm waiting for npx create-react-app to finish running, I can always count on you for a good conversation, and even some insight into how bright your generation is. Even though I'm the older sibling, I look up to you, and your big heart and your bright mind. Always keep your curiosity alive. Can't wait to see where your journey takes you. I love you!

I'd also like to thank my friends, you know who you are. My friends who I know in person, and my friends whom I've met on the internet. We all share in common a unique view of the world as a place of wonder, and opportunity and infity of secrets for us to uncover together. Whether through philosophical debate or through scientific research, let's continue our endevour into discovering this lover letter which our creator wrote to us called the Universe. I love you all!
Your friend & brother and son,
Babekizulu!
